## Requirements

Write a concept and a procedure for how to use your favorite developer tool.

Keep the following information in mind when you are writing:

- Tailor the documentation to a developer audience.
- Use a consistent writing style and terminology throughout the documentation to maintain coherence and clarity.
- Follow the standards in the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
- Incorporate visuals, such as screenshots, diagrams, and workflow charts, to illustrate concepts and procedures effectively.
- Consider usability and accessibility principles to ensure the documentation is accessible to users with diverse backgrounds and abilities.

## Deliverables

I used Armory Continuous Deployment-as-a-Service (CDaaS) daily for about two years. CDaaS was a tool built for software engineers to deploy apps to Kubernetes and AWS Lambda.
